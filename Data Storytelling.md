<h2>5 Types of Audience Members</h2>

- Observer - minimal expectations
- Gatekeeper - wants to see what you have to say impacts their work
- Manager - interested in interdependencies, how departments work together, Action Items
- Expert - will push for greater detail, may derail story
- Executive - How do you see the impact of this on the rest of the organization?  
  Executives do not need to be derailed by trying to understand lots of slides; they are interested in the big picture. Less slides for Executives
  
  <h2>Believe What You Say</h2>
  
  Your audience will better believe you if you are passionate and believe what you are talking about
  Say what you say with strength, clarity, and passion
  
  <b>When telling a story:</b>  
  - Don't create a farfetched story
  - Focus on what you know
  
  <b>Present An Interesting Story</b>
  
  - If you can't present anything interesting, don't present anything at all
  - Connect some part of f yourself to the story
  - Sound like a real person
  - Share sincerely felt emotions, you are more important that data graphs and charts
  
  <h2>The Story With The Data Is What Creates the the Connections</h2>
  
  <h2>Simplifying Visuals</h2>
  
  - Beak data into small digestible pieces - each visualization requires the audience to change focus
  - Make a sitinchtion between data and storytelling
  - Data visualizations, in themselves won't get you very far
  
  <h2>Eliminate And Clutter</h2>
  
  - Make sure visyalizations are as clean as possible
  - Minimize as much as possible
  - Eliminate any distracting information
  - Pull out unnecessary distracting detail information
  - Remove unnecessary text, not every point needs a text label
  - If you're adding more things towards the end, you're probably making it too complex
  
  <h2>Use Metaphores</h2>
  
  - Something familiar is more easily conntected to something unfamiliar
  - Connect somethins unknown, to something known
  - Unstructured Data instead use -> Coffee Shop Chatter, Movie Buzz
  
  - Contrasts are the ability to separate the corrent contect with a vision for the future
  
  <h2>EVA Approach</h2>
  
  - Engagement - engage quickly, not alot of pomp, may need to change format of usually meeting process
